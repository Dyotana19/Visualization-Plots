Dataset URL:  https://tn.data.gov.in/node/6802833#web_catalog_tabs_block_10 



Numerous factors contribute to traffic accidents, including using mobile phones while driving, driving while intoxicated or high on drugs or alcohol, overloading a vehicle, running red lights, speeding through them, passing too quickly, disobeying traffic laws, driving on the wrong side of the road, defects in the condition of the road or vehicles, cyclists' and pedestrians' faults, and more.
We have used the accident data published in the Statistical Handbook of Tamil Nadu 2019 by the Department of Economics and Statistics to derive some inferences using visualization tools.

Scatter plot: Based on the scatter plot drawn between the number of persons injured(2018) and City/District we can observe that there is no correlation between number of injured persons and the City.

Bar plot: Based on the Bar plot generated below, Tirrupur City has the highest number of persons killed in 2018.

Box plot: From the box plot we infer that the total number of accidents in 2018 and the number of persons injured in 2018 have the maximum variance. We can also spot the outliers present in the dataset.
